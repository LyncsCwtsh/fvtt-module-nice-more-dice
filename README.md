# Nice more Dice

![preview](Images/cover.jpg?raw=true)

This module works as an addon to Dice so Nice, adding more textures and dice faces to give users more customization options for their dice.

I encourage testing different combinations of textures and colours out, unless one of the complete dice faces speaks to you. Some textures jump into your face, while others are a lot more subtle.
If a texture comes on too strong or you can’t see it, change the background colour to black or white. The same goes for dice faces - if the dice are completely black, change the colour of the dice to something else.

Everything this module adds is marked with an asterism (⁂) so you can discern between what different DsN addons add.

You can find proper previews with examples [here](https://github.com/LyncsCwtsh/fvtt-module-nice-more-dice/blob/main/Dice%20Preview.md).

### Future Plans
I definitely plan on adding more dice faces when inspiration strikes and I have the time. 

### Feedback
If you have any feedback, feel free to throw a dm in discord at me (LyncsCwtsh#7116). Doesn’t matter if it’s about requests, errors in the code or other dice related musings. Getting feedback also encourages me to figure out how Github works and wrestle with code instead of keeping creations private.
Caveat to requests, please check if [the Rollsmith](https://therollsmith.com) already has something you would like to use. I enjoy creating things others can use and enjoy as well, but I’m not going to replicate anything they have created (they do awesome stuff and I’m looking forward to what they will add next).
